# 1 MF Fundamentals Concepts
As you saw on previous module, there are many career opportunities to work with Mainframe. Our recommendation, if you are starting, is to get familiar with Mainframe by practicing on a environment. No matter which specialty you will be targeting in a near-mid term, a good starting point will be hands on. If you already work with mainframe or has an opportunity to interface with Mainframe that is awesome! If that is not your case, we have some great recommendations to you.

# 2 Master the Mainframe

There is a very nice Hands On environment that IBM built in a gaming layout. It is a nice way to get the first contact with Mainframe. It is free, open to anyone interested to know about mainframe. The environment is open 11 months in a year as a Learning System. If you are a Student, you can earn even more, we encourage you to join it as a competitor. The World wide championship  starts every year on September and ends in December. Every year the environment is re-designed bringing new challenges, based on the new technologies and skills! 

Master the Mainframe is present in more than 3,500 schools in over 130 countries, with the purpose to develop enterprise computing and coding skills in a Mainframe Environment. The environments is build in a modern context using new technologies and tools, such as open source technologies.

The entire challenge is comprised of 3 phases. We encourage you to complete Part 1 and Part 2. As you grow your expertise and fill encourage, go for the Part 3, which is more difficult!

Part 1:  Learn the basics of navigation, files and programs.
Part 2: Practice programming languages, operating systems and technologies.
Part 3: Participate in real-world challenges.
